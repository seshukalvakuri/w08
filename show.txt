The story of Romeo and Juliet
In 1597 William Shakespeare published “Romeo and Juliet”, which was to become one of the most famous love stories in world literature. The story of Shakespeare’s drama is set in Verona, where the two main protagonists, Romeo and Juliet, meet each other and indulge in their love. Both come from two different families, the Capulets and the Montagues, who are sworn enemies. So they decide to keep their love secret and are married by Friar Laurence. Despite all caution, one day Romeo is involved in a fight with Juliet’s cousin Tybalt who he kills in a confrontation. Romeo is banished from Verona and flees to Mantua.

When her parents urge Juliet to marry, she asks Friar Laurence again for help, who gives her a sleeping potion that should fake her death. He explains his plan to Romeo in a letter, which never reaches him. Distraught over the alleged death of his beloved Juliet, Romeo returns to Verona and takes his own life at the open coffin of Juliet. Shortly after, Juliet wakes up from her sleep, sees what has happened and also takes her life. The two feuding families now recognise their complicity and reconcile at the grave of their children
